        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>During the last few minutes of churning, add the chocolate chips to one-third of the mixture, the chopped strawberries to another third, and the chopped mint leaves to the remaining third.</li>
            <li>Once the ice cream reaches a soft-serve consistency, stop the ice cream maker.</li>
            <li>Using an ice cream scoop, layer the three flavors (chocolate chip, strawberry, and mint) in a serving dish or cone to create a triple scoop ice cream.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
